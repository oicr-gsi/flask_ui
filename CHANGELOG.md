## 1.0.0 - 2022-10-10
 - UI is now generated dynamically, presets are harmonized with projectconfig_info on each launch and
   multiple species are supported. Next update should include regression testing. Added BeautifulSoup dependency
   for pretty HTML formatting (maybe useful for developing, but does not have any influence on functionality)
## 0.0.2 - 2022-09-30
 - Most of the important TODO items implemented (dynamic check/updates to presets, defaults) Removed the need for static
   .conf file with defaults. Still need to implement dynamic nested_list generation (interface in html)
## 0.0.1 - 2022-08-04
 - A prototype released for testing by other members of the group. Basic functionality, some bugs may be still present.
