* Regression testing - this can be done fairly quickly, need to test various functions of the
  app with pre-generated inputs. May also simulate adding/removing options to config file
  (projectconfig_info)

* GIT operations - at the moment, the prototype is not capable to interact with a remote repository,
  implementing basic functionality in UI (create a branch, commit push and submit a pull request) 
  will be desirable

* Making the app more robust - as of now, there is no code to ensure a secure, error-resilient
  workflow. There is no syntax check and verification of any pending changes is the human 
  operator's task
