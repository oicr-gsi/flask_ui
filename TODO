* The most pressing item is to make a script that would automatically generate the nested_list.html file
  This script would read a projectconfig file and create an updated .html template for rendering Configuration UI

* GIT operations - at the moment, the prototype is not capable to interact with a remote repository,
  implementing basic functionality in UI (create a branch, commit push and submit a pull request) 
  will be desirable

* Making the app more robust - as of now, there is no code to ensure a secure, error-resilient
  workflow. There is no syntax check and verification of any pending changes is the human 
  operator's task
